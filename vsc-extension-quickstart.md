# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the extension's capabilities and contributions.
* `syntaxes/rvmat.tmLanguage.json` - this is the TextMate grammar file that defines the syntax highlighting rules.
* `language-configuration.json` - this defines language-specific settings like brackets, comments, and folding.
* `extension.js` - this is the JavaScript file that gets executed when the extension is activated.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Create a new file with `.rvmat` extension.
* Verify that syntax highlighting works as expected.

## Make changes

* Changes to `syntaxes/rvmat.tmLanguage.json` will update the syntax highlighting immediately.
* Changes to `language-configuration.json` require reloading the extension (Ctrl+Shift+P → Developer: Reload Window).
* Changes to `extension.js` require reloading the extension (Ctrl+Shift+P → Developer: Reload Window).

## Install your extension

* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
